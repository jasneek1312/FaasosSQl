Faasos Data Analysis Project
Introduction: Imagine you're working at a food delivery company, and you have a bunch of information about drivers, orders, and the food people are ordering. This information is like puzzle pieces that need to be put together to understand how everything works.

Explanation: To start, we organized the information into tables, like organizing your toys into different boxes. We made a box for driver details, one for the types of ingredients, and another for the different types of rolls people order.

For instance, in the "customer_orders" box, we wrote down what rolls people ordered, whether they wanted extra stuff with it, and when they placed the order. In the "driver_order" box, we noted when the drivers picked up the orders, how far they drove, and if they had any problems.

Importance: Imagine you're trying to figure out why some orders take longer or why some drivers seem to cancel deliveries more often. Well, this is where data analysts come in. They're like detectives who dig into this information to find answers.

The messy data, with missing or strange values, is like a mystery that needs solving. Data analysts clean up this messy data to make it easier to understand. By doing this, they can figure out things like which rolls are the most popular, when drivers are busiest, and why some orders might be faster or slower.

Conclusion: In this project, we're like detectives using our magnifying glass on the messy data. We're trying to uncover secrets about which rolls are super popular, how drivers are doing, and why some orders take longer than others. By cleaning up the messy data and looking closely at the information, we can help the food delivery company make things better for both customers and drivers. It's like solving a delicious puzzle to make everyone happy!
